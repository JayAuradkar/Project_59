         <h3>I like coding because it has a lot of mystery in it and I can test new things like this gradient I have put and other things.One more reason I like coding is because you can create games and as you know I like gaming.</h3>

    <h1>About</h1>
        <h2>My hobby is gaming and coding. Whenever I am bored I start playing Games but they are not necessarily video games...I sometimes play board games and also do coding in my free time. I am 10 years old and study in 5th grade. I know looking at a screen for a long time is bad but I dont look at a screen for much time the maximum amount of time I have stared at a screen is 2 hours. Playing games are even eductational sometimes. There are many succesful gamers and game developers and I want to be like one of them.</h2>
